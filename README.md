## *txanalytics (Transaction Analytics)*

The idea of this project is to have configurable data generator to simulate 
payments happening in some bank. API to retrieve such transactions and then 
Jypyter Notebook template to connect to such API and analyze the data.

The project is split into 3 components: `Datagenerator`, `API`, `Notebook`. 
Each of the components has its own dependencies and docker image. 

### DataGenerator

### API
